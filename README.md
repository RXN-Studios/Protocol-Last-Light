# Protocol: Last Light 🕯️🌌

**Protocol: Last Light** is an atmospheric resource management survival game set on a hostile, abandoned planet. Players manage a lone lighthouse—the only safe zone—while venturing into a corrosive "Darkness" to find the parts needed to signal home.

## 🌠 Theme & Pillars

* [cite_start]**The Light is Life:** The lighthouse is your only safety; leaving it transitions the game from a "Safe" state to "Danger"[cite: 264, 265].
* [cite_start]**Corrosive Exploration:** The environment is your primary enemy, acting as a timer that depletes mental and physical resources[cite: 266].
* [cite_start]**Systemic Fragility:** Interconnected systems mean the failure of one resource leads to a total collapse[cite: 267].

## 🛠️ Technical Overview
* [cite_start]**Platform:** PC[cite: 258].
* [cite_start]**Architecture:** Designed with **BlueJ logic** and a robust **State Machine** architecture[cite: 258].
* [cite_start]**Core Loop:** Manage Fuel/Oxygen → Explore the Darkness for Data Fragments → Build Signal Strength → Survive until the final transmission[cite: 261, 262, 272].

## 🎭 The "Absolute Cinema" Ending
[cite_start]The game avoids traditional combat, culminating in a high-stakes transmission sequence where the lighthouse clears the planet's darkness for a final, hopeful message: *"Signal Received. We see you. We are coming."*[cite: 290, 291, 295].
