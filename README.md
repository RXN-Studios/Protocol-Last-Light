Protocol: Last Light 🕯️🌌
Protocol: Last Light is an atmospheric resource management survival game set on a hostile, abandoned planet. Players manage a lone lighthouse—the only safe zone—while venturing into a corrosive "Darkness" to find the parts needed to signal home.

🌠 Theme & Pillars
Theme: Isolation, Perseverance, and the Relief of Connection.

The Light is Life: The lighthouse is your only safety; leaving it transitions the game state from "Safe" to "Danger."

Corrosive Exploration: The environment is your primary enemy, acting as a timer that depletes mental and physical resources.

Systemic Fragility: Interconnected systems mean the failure of one resource leads to a cascading failure of the others.

🛠️ Technical Overview
Platform: PC.

Architecture: Designed with BlueJ logic and a robust State Machine architecture.

Core Loop: Manage Fuel/Oxygen → Explore the Darkness for Data Fragments → Build Signal Strength → Survive until the final transmission.

🎭 The "Absolute Cinema" Ending
The game avoids traditional combat, culminating in a high-stakes transmission sequence where the lighthouse clears the planet's darkness for a final, hopeful message:

"Signal Received. We see you. We are coming."
