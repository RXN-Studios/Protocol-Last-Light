# The Resource Trinity# The Resource Trinity

[cite_start]Success depends on balancing three interconnected resources[cite: 269].

| Resource | Purpose | Penalty at Zero |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fuel** | [cite_start]Powers the Light[cite: 270]. | [cite_start]Safe Zone disappears; structure begins to corrode[cite: 270]. |
| **Oxygen**| [cite_start]Personal survival; consumed faster when sprinting[cite: 271]. | [cite_start]Health failure and increased "Dread"[cite: 271, 289]. |
| **Signal** | [cite_start]The win condition; built using "Data Fragments"[cite: 272]. | [cite_start]Unable to trigger the final Transmission Sequence[cite: 292]. |

## 🔗 System Interdependency
The **Fuel** powers the **Light**, which creates the perimeter needed for **Oxygen** regeneration. [cite_start]Without exploring for **Data Fragments** (Signal), the player cannot progress, but exploration requires spending Fuel and Oxygen[cite: 308].
