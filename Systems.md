# The Resource Trinity

Success depends on balancing three interconnected resources.

| Resource | Purpose | Penalty at Zero |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fuel** | Powers the Light. | Safe Zone disappears; structure begins to corrode. |
| **Oxygen**| Personal survival; consumed faster when sprinting. | Health failure and increased "Dread". |
| **Signal** | The win condition; built using "Data Fragments". | Unable to trigger the final Transmission Sequence. |

## 🔗 System Interdependency
The **Fuel** powers the **Light**, which creates the perimeter needed for **Oxygen** regeneration. Without exploring for **Data Fragments** (Signal), the player cannot progress, but exploration requires spending Fuel and Oxygen.
