# Narrative & Atmospheric Storytelling

## 📖 The World
*Protocol: Last Light* is set on a hostile planet that was once colonized but now stands abandoned. The story is told through environmental cues and high-tension gameplay rather than traditional dialogue.

## 📜 Discovery Items
* **Old Logbooks:** Scattered throughout the world, these provide context on previous lighthouse keepers and their ultimate fate.
* **Broken Tech:** Found in the Darkness, these items suggest the history of the planet's failed colonization attempt.
* **Auditory Hallucinations:** As Oxygen levels drop, players hear whispers that hint at the psychological toll of isolation and the mental strain of the environment.

## 🎬 The Ending: Transmission Sequence
The game concludes with a cinematic Transmission Sequence rather than a boss fight:
1. **The Signal:** Once the player reaches 100% Signal, the final sequence triggers.
2. **Super-Fuel:** The player must craft a high-energy cell to power the final transmission.
3. **The Whiteout:** The lighthouse beam turns a blinding white, momentarily clearing the entire planet of the "Darkness."
4. **The Response:** The terminal displays a single incoming text response: *"Signal Received. We see you. We are coming."*
